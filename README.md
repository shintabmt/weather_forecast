MVVM Architecture is one of the most popular and latest architecture to develop a maintanable and managable codebase. We are developing a sample `Weater Forecast` Android App with `MVVM Architecture` using `Kotlin` language and `Retrofit` network calling library.

#### The app has following packages:

1. **data**: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
2. **ui**: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel.
3. **utils**: Utility classes.

### Open Weather API

We will use [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for collecting weather information.

### Run the project

- Clone the project and open it using Android Studio.
- Sync the `Gradle` and run the project. Install APK on your emulator or real device. Turn on the internet of your testing device.
